# Phonebook App

Phonebook is a simple React application that allows you to manage a list of
contacts. You can add new contacts, delete existing ones, and filter the list to
find specific contacts. This readme file provides an overview of the Phonebook
application and how to use it.

- **Add a Contact**: You can add a new contact to the phonebook by providing
  their name and phone number.

  UPDATE v3: When you add and delete a contact, the contacts are stored in the
  local storage. When the application is loaded, contacts, if any, are read from
  local storage and are written to the state.

- **Delete a Contact**: You can remove a contact from the phonebook.

- **Filter Contacts**: You can filter the list of contacts by name to quickly
  find the ones you're looking for.

## Installation

To run the Phonebook application locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   cd [repository-name]

   ```

3. Install and start dependencies:
